## How It Works

BlinkMore is your personal eye-care buddy, designed to help you blink more. It uses your Mac’s built-in camera for eye-tracking and encoruages you to blink when you’ve been staring too long—keeping your eyes lubricated and refreshed.

Here’s the simple rundown:

- Eye Check: The app uses your camera to notice if your eyes have been open for a while without blinking. When it’s time, it fades your screen a little to nudge you to blink—no harsh interruptions, just a soft hint!
- Privacy First: Everything happens right on your Mac—no data leaves your device or sticks around after you close the app.
- Customizable Comfort: You can adjust how fast the screen fades, how often it reminds you, and even pick the fade color—whatever feels right for you.

Tips for the best experience:

- Make sure your Mac’s camera has a clear view of your eyes (heads-up: glasses with certain angles/reflections might obstruct camera view).
- It’s perfect for reading or focusing on text-heavy tasks—just know it uses a good chunk of your Mac’s power. 

BlinkMore is all about helping you build better screen habits, one blink at a time, so your eyes stay happy!
