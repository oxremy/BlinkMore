# BlinkMore

BlinkMore is a macOS menu bar application that helps reduce eye strain by fading your screen to a customizable color when you stare at it for too long without blinking. It uses automated eye-tracking.

## Features

- **Menu Bar App**: Runs efficiently in the background with minimal resource usage
- **Automated Eye-Tracking**: Monitors your blinking patterns and fades the screen automatically
- **Customizable Settings**:
  - Fade Speed: Adjust how quickly the screen fades
  - Fade Color: Choose any color for the screen overlay
  - Time Between Blinks: Set how long to wait before triggering a fade 
  - Eye-Tracking: Enable/disable automated monitoring

## Requirements

- macOS 12 (Monterey) or later
- Camera access (for eye-tracking feature)

- All processing happens locally on your device
- No video is ever stored or transmitted
- The macOS camera indicator light will be on when eye-tracking is active
