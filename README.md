# BlinkMoreFree

BlinkMoreFree is an open source macOS menu bar application that helps reduce eye strain by fading your screen when you stare at it for too long without blinking. Using automated eye-tracking and customized settings to encourage you to blink more.

# [BlinkMore](http://oxremy.github.io/BuyBlinkMore/)
If you like the free version consider [BlinkMore](http://oxremy.github.io/BuyBlinkMore/). Main difference: eye tracking turns on/off based on the app you are using, saving energy by only turning on for apps you choose. I like to use with text-heavy tasks like reading/research. 

## Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later 
- Uses Mac's built-in front facing camera 

## Privacy

Everything happens right on your Mac—no data leaves your device or sticks around after you close the app. No accounts or personal information needed.

## Tips for Best Experience 

- Make sure your Mac's camera has a clear view of your eyes (heads-up: glasses at certain angles may have reflections that obstruct camera view).
- Consider the angle of your camera. Blink detection may not work at extreme angles, like laying in bed with Mac on your lap.
- BlinkMoreFree is perfect for text-heavy tasks like reading––just know it uses a good chunk of your Mac's power.
